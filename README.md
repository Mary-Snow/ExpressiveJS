# watch-dog
End to end server tracking for optimal debugging

Note: WE CLAIM _WD NAMESPACE ON RES.LOCALS

setup a watchDog.log to keep track of what watchDog does and how it's performing?

if we are running a browser to send http requests, should we open the resulting html in that browser? (i.e. should we use chromium instead of a headless browser?)
  -> Then we could write a command for the cli that opens the browser with the output HTML

SHOULD WE START A WEBSITE FOR OUR DOCS? WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO START WORKING ON OUR DOCUMENTATION?
