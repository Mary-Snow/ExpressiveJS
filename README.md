# Expressive.js
> End to end server route tracking for [Express](https://expressjs.com/) applications.



### Install
```$ npm install expressivejs --save-dev```



## Basic Setup

### 1) Modify Express server files
Replace all instances of  ```var express = require('express');```

with ```var express = require('expressivejs');```

This will enable Expressive to progressively document the state of client requests and server responses.


### 2) *(Optional)* Create a configuration file

This file should be called __expressive.config.js__ and be located in your application's root directory.

#### Options:
TBD

#### Default Settings:
TBD



## Testing Server Routes

### Command Line Scripts

__```$ xpr-test```: Test your server routes__.  Sends http requests to your Express server using request methods, routes, and bodies specified either by your __expressive.config.js__ configuration file or by Expressive's default settings.  This will create an __expressive.json__ file in your application's root directory where information on request and response states is stored.

__```$ xpr-display```: Render a visualization__ of your server routes based on the __expressive.json__ file created from the *xpr-test* command.

__```$ xpr```: Test your server routes__ and then __render a visualization__.  Equivalent to running *xpr-test* followed by *xpr-display*.



## Important

### Do not alter res.locals._XPR
Any server middleware that alters __res.locals._XPR__ will interfere with Expressive's functionality.  Expressive tracks the state of client requests and server responses by storing information at the _XPR key within the locals property of the server response body.

### Expressive is not for use in production
Be sure to change all instances of ```var express = require('expressive');``` back to ```var express = require('express');``` before running your application for non-testing purposes.
